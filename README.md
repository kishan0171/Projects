A table with the 7 records that uses a library such as Angular's UI Grid to give it more interaction. 
Some features this table should have Sorting, Pagination. Extra features this table could have Column Resizing, Column Reordering,
Column Hiding, Filtering, Exporting to csv, pdf.

Edit link to bring up an edit form or trigger inline editing (for bonus points) for each record.  
I’d like to see the species and condition lists to be HTML select objects.

A report (HTML table is fine) that outputs trees that have a duplicate “site number”. 
We have a tree locating mechanism where Address, Street, Side, and Site number (columns B,C,D,E in sheet) cannot be duplicated.  
That is, those four values combined are unique to the dataset.  Create a report that alerts the user to the duplicate records.
